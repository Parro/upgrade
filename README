*** CakePHP2.0 upgrade shell - improved version ***

The original one lacks a lot of things that could be done automatically.
Changes have been reported as ticket, but so far it has not yet made it into the official version.

This version supports now on top of the original commands/tasks:
- paginator
- database
- legacy
- name
- constructors
- webroot
- report
and many more

New functionally also supported now:
- svn
- group commands

As this is a plugin, use it with:
    cake Upgrade.Upgrade [command]


Additionally you can use the CorrectShell to correct
- request
- amp
- vis
- reference
- i18n

with
    cake Upgrade.Correct [command]
 
Tip: Use 
    cake Upgrade.Correct all
to quickly apply all relevant correction commands
